# Full-page screenshots

Available from extension Quick Actions or from an Agent through `bsk screenshot --full-page`.
The capture, disk tiles and streaming PNG encoder are shared.

Open **Quick actions → Full-page screenshot** in the BrowserSkill popup. Choose:

- **Full page · Automatic**: captures from the top, scrolls incrementally and follows appended content.
- **Long image · I scroll**: captures from the current position while you scroll down. Keep overlapping
  content between screens. Reopen the popup and choose **Finish and keep** when you are done.
- **Visible area**: captures the current viewport once.

The Quick Actions feature works with the CLI connection off. It does not require the CLI, daemon or an Agent session.
After installing or reloading the extension, automatic capture reconnects the screenshot content
script in already-open pages on demand. Injection targets only the captured document and retries
once; navigation, cancellation and timeouts remain errors instead of changing capture mode.

Automatic capture stitches using measured document coordinates with overlapping viewports.
At the bottom it waits for at least 1.5 seconds of stable height and 600 ms without nearby
content changes. Rendered loading text or accessibility busy/indeterminate progress indicators near the
document tail keep capture open until loading ends; **Finish and keep** and cancellation
remain available. This avoids making every ordinary scroll slower. A page that keeps loading
can still require an explicit Finish, or reach an Agent's configured deadline.
Without a loading indicator, the quiet wait is bounded to five seconds so a ticking clock
or other widget that changes text without changing page height cannot hold capture open forever.

If appended content moves the old bottom, capture rewinds to the provisional tail, including
semantic page footers and loading rows, and replaces those disk tiles before continuing.
Fixed bottom overlays are exposed only for the settled final frame. No full-image canvas or
whole-page rescan is needed for that repair.

## Agent and CLI

```sh
bsk screenshot --session <id> --full-page --out page.png
bsk screenshot --session <id> --full-page --timeout 5m --out page.png --json
bsk screenshot --session <id> --full-page --scope current --out loaded.png --json
```

`--scope follow` (the default) follows appended content. `--scope current` captures
only the document region measured at capture start, in CSS pixels. It still scrolls
through that region to expose lazy images, but later height growth does not extend
the range. Layout shifts can move content past that boundary; this mode is a bounded
visual capture, not a promise to include every initially present article. The loading
row remains visible. Success means the selected range was captured, not that the
website finished loading. JSON results include the acknowledged `scope`; the CLI
refuses to save a `current` request if an older extension does not acknowledge it.

On Windows, Agent captures prefer their session's renderer screenshot source to
avoid stale window-surface pixels seen after script-driven scrolling on some builds.
Those captures also check compact frame signatures against the measured displacement
and retry a clearly stale frame twice before failing with `stale_frame`. Blank or
ambiguous content alone does not trigger this error. Layout and stale-frame retries
have separate consecutive-failure counters.

On other platforms, Agent captures retain a working window-surface source and fall
back to their session renderer only if the initial probe fails. Popup captures keep
their existing backend selection and do not enable the Agent freshness check.
Screenshot backends never switch midway through an image.

In Agent `follow` mode, 30 seconds at an unchanged bottom with a rendered loading
indicator produces `loading_stalled`, rather than waiting until the total deadline.
This saves no partial image. Errors carry phase, frame count, progress and captured
height when available. `user_cancelled`, `page_hidden`, `navigation` and
`watchdog_timeout` distinguish user input, visibility changes, navigation and lost
page contact. Keeping the tab selected is necessary; hiding it can stop capture.
Individual browser operations retain their own shorter deadlines.

The default viewport screenshot and `--ref` crop are unchanged. `--full-page` is exclusive
with `--ref`. An optional `--tab-id` must identify the selected tab in the session's Agent
Window; the tab must have been created or borrowed by that session. Automatic document
scrolling is transient page input and obeys the existing user-interrupt gate. It supports
scriptable HTTP(S) pages, not restricted browser pages or nested/virtualized scrollers.

Agent capture restores scroll and temporary styles on completion, failure, timeout or
cancellation. Ctrl-C cancels capture or transfer; a page navigation or tab switch stops the
capture. Unlike interactive Quick Actions, an Agent failure never returns partial success.
The capture/encoding deadline is two minutes by default and can be changed with `--timeout`.
No fixed page-height or full-image canvas limit is added. Infinite scrolling may reach the
deadline. The popup and any existing user previews are independent of Agent captures.

`bsk screenshot --full-page` uses `tool.screenshot_full_page`, followed by internal
`tool.screenshot_read` and `tool.screenshot_release` RPCs. This distinct capture method lets
the daemon gate scrolling and wait for cancellation cleanup without changing the existing
passive `tool.screenshot` route. Full-page requests use `session_id`, optional `tab_id` and
optional `timeout_ms` and `scope` (`follow` or `current`). Results include the acknowledged
`scope` and dimensions, `format: "png"`, `tab_id`, `byte_size`,
optional dialogs and an opaque session-scoped `capture_id`; they contain no whole-image
base64 or agent filesystem path. Read requests use `session_id`, `capture_id` and byte
`offset`, returning at most 256 KiB encoded as `data_base64`, `next_offset` and `eof`.
Release uses `session_id` and `capture_id` and returns `released`.

The extension streams its PNG to OPFS; the CLI receives bounded chunks and atomically
replaces the chosen output only after validating the complete byte count. Existing screenshot
JSON output fields are preserved. There is no preview tab, browser download or additional
permission. Exports are released after successful saving or local failure/cancellation,
on session stop, and after ten minutes without reads. Closed-session exports are also swept
once per minute. After a worker restart, orphan Agent scratch directories are removed before
the next full-page capture; popup previews are retained. Temporary storage initialization failures
can be retried. Releasing an export immediately revokes reads; failed disk deletions are retried
by the minute sweep without retaining image Blobs. CLI or browser crashes can therefore
leave temporary disk data until this cleanup runs. Matching CLI and extension builds are
required. Restart a running daemon after updating the CLI (`bsk daemon restart`); older extensions reject the new RPC rather than returning an incorrect viewport.

## Controls and page access

Pause and resume a capture, or finish early and keep the captured portion. While automatic capture is
paused, you can load additional content; resuming returns to the captured position. Cancel discards
the current capture. Automatic captures restore the original scroll position and temporary styles
when they finish or stop. Manual mode leaves the page at the user's chosen position.

The popup's finished result belongs to its source tab and page. Switching to another webpage,
navigating the source tab, or closing it discards that popup state; returning later starts fresh.
Reopening the popup on the same page retains the result. Opening the capture's own preview does
not count as leaving the capture flow, and an already-open preview remains usable for export
after the popup state is cleared.

Keep the captured tab selected and its viewport size stable. Navigation, resizing, capture failures
and storage errors preserve durable tiles and identify the result as partial. A restarted background
worker can reopen the committed portion. Individual browser operations still have timeouts, but
there is no fixed whole-job duration, scroll count, 32K image-height or 48-megapixel cutoff.
Navigation checks observe the top-level document. Background loading of ads or other embedded
frames does not cancel an otherwise stable capture just because the tab reports `loading`.

Clicking the extension grants `activeTab` for the current tab. This enables visible-area screenshots
of Chrome internal pages and the Chrome Web Store as well as ordinary websites. These restricted
pages do not permit content-script injection. Automatic mode explains the failure and offers an
explicit **Use manual scrolling** action; it never silently changes the selected capture mode.
Browser/enterprise capture policies and user permissions still apply. Restricted-page support does
not bypass Chrome's scripting or debugger restrictions.

Manual mode matches overlapping pixels without reading the page DOM. Textured patches across
horizontal regions vote on the displacement, excluding stationary sidebars and tolerating local
animation. It excludes static header and footer bands and replaces the reliable overlap to remove
old floating footers. A transient miss gets another exposure before showing an alignment notice;
the last accepted frame stays the anchor, and ambiguous frames never enter the image.
Blank/repeated/animated or insufficiently overlapping content may be ambiguous. In that case the
capture keeps its last good frame and asks the user to scroll back for more overlap; it never invents
a match. Independently scrolling panels, moving sidebars and virtualized layouts can still need
manual adjustment; this is not a promise of automatic capture of every browser UI.

## Storage, memory and export

New captures are a collection of 512-pixel-high PNG tiles in the extension's Origin Private File
System (OPFS), with a small durable manifest. Only the current screenshot and a small working canvas
are decoded while capturing. Appending content and replacing a footer do not allocate a full-page
canvas. Thumbnails are generated for fitting large images into the preview.

The preview mounts only visible tiles and adjacent tiles. It rebases its scrollbar for very long
images to avoid CSS element-height limits. Zooming to original size loads original tiles.
Previous single-PNG previews stored in IndexedDB remain readable.

Downloading launches a dedicated worker. It reads tiles sequentially, applies the PNG Up filter and
uses native streaming zlib compression to write PNG chunks to an OPFS file. The browser downloads
the resulting file; no full-image pixel buffer or base64 export is built. Export can be cancelled
without losing the captured tiles. There is no upload and no new third-party encoding dependency.

Disk usage grows with the capture. Browser storage quotas, available disk space, PNG format bounds
and external image-viewer capabilities remain real constraints. The preview does not decode the
entire exported PNG, so its working memory is independent of total image height. This controls the
screenshot feature's buffers, not the memory used by a webpage's own DOM or loading behavior.

## Verification

For the actual CLI → daemon → extension chain, build `bsk` and the extension, then run:

```sh
cargo build -p bsk --locked
pnpm ext:build
BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_CHROME=/path/to/chrome BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_CLI="$PWD/target/debug/bsk" pnpm --filter @browser-skill/extension exec vitest run src/long-screenshot/agent.browser.test.ts
```

This suite uses an isolated browser profile, daemon and child-process user home (including
skill-directory overrides). A managed skill fixture verifies that daemon startup sync stays in
that home; update checks use the local fixture server and automatic updates are disabled.
It verifies PNG scanlines and fixed
footers, multi-chunk transfer, captures beyond 32K pixels, original page restoration, timeout,
Ctrl-C, the page Escape control, output failures and scratch-file cleanup. The regular suites cover chunk ownership,
invalid offsets, expiration, CLI flag validation and the unchanged viewport/ref routes.
Fault-injection tests cover unresponsive overlay replies during cancellation/timeout, storage
initialization recovery, and retrying failed artifact deletion. Overlay cleanup uses a bounded
wait and still targets the original document after cancellation.


The automated checks cover actual scroll-offset rounding, fixed-footer overlap, capture beyond
120 frames, early finish, cancellation, DOM cleanup, paused interaction, restricted-page errors,
streaming PNG round trips, export cancellation and disk failures. Manual alignment tests cover
fixed bars, exact pixel offsets, ambiguous repeated content and non-overlapping jumps.
They also cover delayed multi-batch loading above a tall flow footer, repainting all old footer
rows, fixed sidebars with sparse scrolling content, local animation, and shorter valid overlaps.

Build and run the real extension in an isolated Chrome profile:

```sh
pnpm ext:build
BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_CHROME=/path/to/chrome pnpm --filter @browser-skill/extension exec vitest run src/long-screenshot/long-screenshot.browser.test.ts
```

The extension tests cover automatic and manual capture, popup closure, pause/resume, early finish,
page restoration, reconnecting after an extension reload, native downloads, Chrome internal pages
and the Chrome Web Store. Restricted-page
tests invoke the real extension action through the browser's extension testing API to grant activeTab.
Set `BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_URL` to additionally check an ordinary public website and
`BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_OUTPUT` to retain its result metadata and preview screenshot.

A standalone renderer suite exercises the production capture, OPFS store, PNG export and built
preview, including fractional/Retina scales, lazy loading and a 3,170 × 100,062-pixel result:

```sh
BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_RENDERER=/path/to/chrome-headless-shell pnpm --filter @browser-skill/extension exec vitest run src/long-screenshot/renderer.browser.test.ts
```

Set `BSK_LONG_SCREENSHOT_OUTPUT` to retain PNGs and buffer measurements. The 100,062-pixel run used
only canvases at most 512 pixels high; instrumented canvas and live ImageBitmap RGBA buffers peaked
at 43,705,488 bytes (about 41.7 MiB), while a full RGBA image would require 1,268,786,160 bytes.
This measurement excludes codec internals, ImageData/filter buffers, JavaScript heap, GPU copies,
the webpage and other Chrome processes; it is not a measurement of total browser memory.
