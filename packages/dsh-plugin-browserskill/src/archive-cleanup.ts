/**
 * Archive-triggered bsk session cleanup. DSH conversation archival writes
 * the workspace registry's durable global state, which the storage domain
 * broadcasts as `domain/changed` ({domain: 'workspace', table: ''}) with
 * the new `archivedSessionIds`. The watcher diffs that set and stops every
 * bsk session owned by a freshly archived conversation — archived sessions
 * are hidden from every surface, so their Agent Windows would otherwise
 * linger with no way back to them.
 *
 * Ownership lineage: browser_session action=start records the calling agent's
 * session id PLUS every ancestor along `header.parentSession` (a subagent's
 * browsers are reaped when any ancestor is archived, the root conversation
 * included). Lineage is resolved through the host session store; an
 * unloaded ancestor simply ends the walk.
