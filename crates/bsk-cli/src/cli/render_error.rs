//! Single source of truth for the human-readable summary, repair
//! hint, and exit code attached to every [`ErrorCode`] variant.
//!
//! Keeping the table in one place means:
//!   * the renderer in [`super::error::render`] never invents
//!     ad-hoc copy or exit codes,
//!   * `bsk-cli` subcommands that surface their own bespoke
//!     `eprintln!("error: ...")` lines are obvious anomalies during
//!     review, and
//!   * the M10.3 unit tests can lock in `ErrorCode → exit_code` so a
//!     silent regression bumps a test failure rather than escaping
//!     into shell scripts that depend on the documented contract.
//!
//! Exit code mapping follows design §3.1:
//!   * `0` — success (never produced by this module),
//!   * `1` — user error (parameters / sandbox / missing entity),
//!   * `2` — protocol or transport error (incl. `cancelled`),
//!   * `3` — browser / CDP failure,
//!   * `4` — timeout,
//!   * `5` — version mismatch.
//!
//! Strings are in English: the CLI is consumed by agents and other
//! automated tooling, so all user-facing copy uses English. Command
//! names, flags, field names, and `ErrorCode` literal values are
//! also English so the wire / CLI contract stays unambiguous. There
//! is no i18n framework wired up yet; if we ever introduce one, the
//! `summary` and `hint` strings here are the obvious extraction
//! candidates (one key per `ErrorCode` variant).
//!
//! `cancelled` is intentionally not in the design's enumerated table
//! but currently lands on `2` to keep parity with M3.5 behaviour and
//! the existing exit-code unit test. Tests that want to discriminate
//! cancellation should match on `ErrorCode::Cancelled` directly.
